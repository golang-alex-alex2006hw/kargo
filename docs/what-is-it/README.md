# What is it ?

**kargo** allows you to deliver your own data in a few minutes using Geospatial Open Standards such as [WMS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms), [WMTS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts), [WCS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs), [WFS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs).... 

Indeed, **kargo** relies on well known Open Source geospatial solutions and takes advantages of their strongest features:

1. [**PostGis**](http://postgis.net/)
2. [**GeoServer**](http://geoserver.org/)
3. [**MapProxy**](https://mapproxy.org/)
4. [**TileServer-GL**](http://tileserver.org/)

It is designed to be deployed on Docker based infrastructures and specifically on Docker Swarm cluster created using [Kaabah](https://kalisio.github.io/kaabah/). It allows you to manage, extent the platform with ease.

::: tip Note
The **Kargo** project was initiated by [Kalisio](https://kalisio.com) to provide us with the necessary Geospatial Services we need to support our development.<br/><br/>
