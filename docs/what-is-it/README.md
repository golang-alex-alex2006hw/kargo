# What is it ?

**kargo** allows you to deliver your own data in a few minutes using Geospatial Open Standards such as [WMS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms), [WMTS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts), [WCS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs), [WFS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs)... Indeed, **kargo** relies on well known Open Source geospatial solutions and takes advantages of their strongest features:

1. [**PostGis**](http://postgis.net/)
2. [**GeoServer**](http://geoserver.org/)
3. [**MapProxy**](https://mapproxy.org/)
4. [**TileServer-GL**](http://tileserver.org/)

**Kargo** is designed to be deployed on Docker based infrastructures and specifically on Docker Swarm cluster. Benefit from [Kaabah](https://kalisio.github.io/kaabah/) to create your infrastructure and manage your platform of services with ease.

**Kargo** was initiated by [Kalisio](https://kalisio.com) to provide us with the necessary Geospatial Services we need to support our development.<br/><br/>
